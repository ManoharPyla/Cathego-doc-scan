    "content": "Meal Plan Overview for Weight Gain:  ●   Goal:   Include traditional Gujarati foods that are easy to make, calorie-dense, and rich in healthy fats, proteins, and carbs.  ●   Focus:   Increase calorie intake with wholesome, familiar foods that she can enjoy regularly.  Breakfast:  1.   Thepla with Ghee and Yogurt  ○   2 Theplas (made with whole wheat flour, fenugreek, and spices)  ○   1 tablespoon ghee (to spread on the thepla)  ○   1 small bowl of full-fat yogurt  ○   Why it helps:   Thepla is easy to digest, and the ghee adds extra calories. Full-fat yogurt is high in protein and fat, making it a perfect breakfast.  Mid-Morning Snack:  2.   Makhana (Fox Nuts) and Nuts Mix  ○   A handful of roasted makhana (fox nuts)  ○   A small handful of cashews, almonds, or peanuts  ○   1 tablespoon of sesame seeds (til) for added healthy fats  ○   Why it helps:   Makhana is low in calories but rich in protein. Nuts and sesame seeds are calorie-dense and packed with healthy fats and proteins.  Lunch:  3.   Dal Dhokli (Gujarati-style)  ○   1 bowl of dal (moong dal or toor dal) cooked with spices (turmeric, cumin, mustard seeds, etc.)  ○   1 cup of whole wheat dhokli (thin wheat dough pieces cooked in the dal)  ○   1 tablespoon ghee on top  ○   Serve with a side of   rice   (1/2-1 cup) or   roti   (1-2)  ○   Why it helps:   Dal Dhokli is filling, rich in protein, and high in carbs. Ghee adds a caloric boost, and rice/roti helps with carbs for energy.\n\nAfternoon Snack:  4.   Handvo or Dhokla  ○   1-2 pieces of homemade handvo or dhokla (fermented savory cakes made with rice and lentils)  ○   1 glass of buttermilk or a small glass of full-fat milk  ○   Why it helps:   Both handvo and dhokla are high in protein and carbs. The buttermilk provides probiotics and adds calories to her daily intake.  Dinner:  5.   Undhiyu with Roti or Paratha  ○   1 bowl of Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable curry made with winter vegetables like yam, eggplant, potatoes, and beans, cooked in lots of oil or ghee)  ○   1-2 rotis or 1-2 parathas (made with whole wheat flour, adding ghee or butter on top)  ○   Why it helps:   Undhiyu is calorie-dense with healthy fats, fiber, and protein. Adding ghee or butter to the roti/paratha boosts calorie intake.  Before Bed Snack:  6.   Halwa or Khir (Sweet Dish)  ○   Carrot Halwa (Gajar no Halwo)   or   Suji Halwa (Semolina Pudding)   made with full-fat milk, sugar, and ghee  ○   A small handful of nuts for extra calories (optional)  ○   Why it helps:   These sweet dishes are calorie-dense and packed with good fats and sugar, which will help her consume more calories before bed.  Additional Tips for Weight Gain:  1.   Use Ghee or Oil Generously:   Cooking with ghee or adding oil (like olive oil) to vegetables, rice, and roti will increase the calorie intake without requiring her to eat more food.  2.   Add Paneer or Cheese:   Paneer (cottage cheese) can be easily added to curries or vegetables. It’s rich in protein and fat. Cheese can be added to meals or snacks to increase calories.  3.   Drink Full-Fat Milk and Shakes:   Encourage her to drink full-fat milk or homemade milkshakes (with banana, nuts, and milk) throughout the day to help her consume more calories without feeling too full.\n\n4.   Opt for Energy-Dense Snacks:   Foods like   khakra ,   sev , or   murmura   (puffed rice) with a bit of ghee and sugar can be eaten as snacks, which are filling and calorie-dense.  5.   Increase the Protein Content:   Along with dals, encourage foods like   chana  (chickpeas),   moong beans ,   lentils , and   paneer . All are inexpensive but rich in protein.  Workout Recommendations:  Even if she’s not able to go to the gym, some basic bodyweight exercises can help her build muscle, which will contribute to healthy weight gain. Simple movements like squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks can be done at home.",
